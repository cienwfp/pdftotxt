# pdfTotxt

This project converts pdf file to txt. This demand arose from the request of the co-worker.

1. Create env with conda ou pip.
2. Install the dependencies using "sudo apt install build-essential libpoppler-cpp-dev pkg-config python3-dev"
3. Run pip3 -r requeriments.txt
 
After, open the terminal and navigate to the folder where the working folder was saved and run python3 main.py.
